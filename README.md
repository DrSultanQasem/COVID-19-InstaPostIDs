# COVID19 Instagram Post IDs

The repository includes an ongoing collection of Instagram Posts IDs correlated with the new coronavirus COVID-19. The first version of this data collection process started on January 5, 2020 and continued until March 30, 2020. The data gathering is still running as the lockdown has not been finished in many countries around the world (at the time of writing this paper).

We hope that the dataset can support diverse research activities. Below we list a subset of potential topics, we believe the dataset could support:

- Fake news, misinformation and rumors spreading.
- Behavioral change analysis during the pandemic.
- Information sharing related Covid-19.
- etc.
