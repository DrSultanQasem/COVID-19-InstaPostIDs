# COVID-19-InstaPostIDs

The repository includes an ongoing collection of Instagram Posts IDs correlated with the new coronavirus COVID-19. The first version of this data collection process started on January 5, 2020 and continued until March 30, 2020. The data gathering is still running as the lockdown has not been finished in many countries around the world (at the time of writing this paper). 

### Data Collection
We have collected public posts from Instagram by crawling all posts associated with a set of COVID-19 hashtags including *#coronavirus*, *#covid19*, *#covid_19*, and *#corona*.
